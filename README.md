# Data Structures And Algorithms

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/LiadiJason/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms)

## Overview

This repository serves as a playground for practicing and sharpening my skills in data structures and algorithms. Here, you will find various implementations of essential data structures and algorithms in Java. Additionally, I've incorporated the JUnit testing framework to ensure the correctness of the implementations and track line coverage. The repository also provides information about the Big O notation, which includes time complexity and space complexity analysis for each algorithm.

## Key Features

- Well-organized code showcasing different data structures and algorithms.
- Utilizes the JUnit framework for comprehensive testing and line coverage analysis.
- Continuous updates and improvements to ensure code quality and efficiency.
- Extensive code commenting for clarity and educational purposes.

## Testing

The repository includes a comprehensive set of JUnit test cases to verify the correctness of the data structure and algorithm implementations. These tests ensure that the code performs as expected under various scenarios and edge cases.

## Big O Notation

Each algorithm is accompanied by an analysis of its time complexity and space complexity using Big O notation. This analysis helps understand the efficiency and performance characteristics of the implementations.
